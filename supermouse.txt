1/ What is Supermouse for?
--------------------------
Supermouse enables you to build scripts which perform repetitive mouse
tasks. But it also go a step farther, and brings the possibility to check
the screen in order to decide which task to proceed. Here is the liste of
the possible actions for a Supemouse script:
- Mouse actions (move in line, ine circle, several clicks)
- Wait (duration or pixel color)
- Loop (duration or number)
- Condition (depending on a pixel color)
- Label and Goto
- Execute an external application
- Send keys
- Display a message


2/ Installation
---------------
Supermouse.exe is a stand alone program but it requires that your system has 
the VB6 Runtime.

VB6 Runtime :
Supermouse is developped with Visual Basic 6. Which means that it requires
the VB6 Runtime. The VB6 Runtime is provided by default with
Windows 98 or higger. If you don't have it, then an error message will be
prompt as soon as you open Supermouse.exe. Then you will have to download
the VB6 Runtime at the Microsoft web site.
(I don't give the download URL because it might change)

3.a Building a script
---------------------
A script is composed by several actions which are executed in order.
The script stops when it met the last action.
The main window shows you the list of actions of the script in the order
they will be executed. You can add an action by choosing the type of action
in the list and click on the button [insert]. The action list allways
contains a special End label at the bottom of the list.
This End label cannot be edited or deleted, and you cannot insert an action
after.
You can edit, delete or change the order of other actions in the list.

For most of the action, you can enter a caption for the action list in the
main window. You can also enabled or disabled each action.

3.b Actions
-----------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Mouse

Choos a move in line (stanard move), in circle, or no move.
A move in line can be combined with any button action (clicks) 
before or after the move.

If it's move in circle, then buttons actions can only be a drag'n drop, and
The coordinates are the center of the circle and you can specify a radius.

The coordinate of the point to reach can be relative to the screen, the
active window or the median.
You can click on [Locate] to set the coordinates automatically.

You can specify a speed for the move:
0 means immediatly.
1 means 100 pixel/sec
10 is a slow for drag'n drop
20 is a normal for drag'n drop
30 is quick but ok for drag'n drop

-> Wait

You can wait for a duration or wait until a specified pixel of the screen
takes a specific color. You can combine both.
See the Mouse action for more detail about how to set the coordinates.

-> Loop

A Loop action displays two items in the action list: the beginning of the
loop and the end of the loop. You can move the position of the end and the
beginning of a loop in the action list.

A loop enables the script to repeat the actions which are between the
beginning and the end of the loop until a duration or until a number of
times.

-> Condition

This action enables to to jump to another action or to continue the
script depending to the color of a specified pixel.
See the Mouse action for more detail about how to set the coordinates.
See the Goto action for more detail about how to set the jumps.

-> Label and Goto

A label is a locator to which you can jump from Goto action or a 
Condition action.
The name of the label must be unique in the script. Take care of that.
'End' and 'Return' are reserved words and must not be use as a label name.

A Goto action just enables you to jump to a label.
'End' and 'Return' are reserved word for a jump action.
Goto 'End' stops the script.
Goto 'Return' jumps to the action just after the last performed
Goto action. Be careful when using a Goto 'Return' because it doesn't
suppport embeded Goto in this version of SuperMouse.

-> Execute

Execute a DOS command line.
This is useful to start a new application.
For example : iexplore.exe "http://www.skrol29.com/"

-> Keys

simulate a send keys.
You can use special keywords for special keys :
~ or {ENTER} = [Enter]
{ESC} = [Escape]
+ = [Shift]
^ = [Ctrl]
% = [Alt]
{DEL} = [Delete]
{TAB} = [Tab]
{LEFT} = [Left]
{RIGHT} = [Right]
{UP} = [Up]
{DOWN} = [Down]
...
(see the help of the SendKeys Visual Basic function for more keywords)


-> Message

Display message in a standard dialog box.
The script waits until someone clicks on the [Ok] button.

-> Comment

This action has no effect.
It just enables you to have a comment in your script.

3.c Open and save a script
--------------------------

main window menu 'File'.
You can also open a SMS file in order to run it or to modify it.

3.d Run and stop a script
-------------------------

You can start a script manually from the main window menu by choosing
'Tool'/'Run'.
You can also start a script automatically by using a command line.
See the 'Command line parameters' chapter for more details.

main window menu.
The options are available only for the current script and are saved with
the script.
